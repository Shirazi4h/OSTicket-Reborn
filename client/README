INSTALLATION

- First of all backup all your data before you continue.
- Upload client.tar.gz to your installed osTicket root folder.
- Uncompress file (tar -zxf client.tar.gz)
- Now you should see a folder "client" inside your root osTicket folder, don't go there yet!.
- Modify file client.inc.php located at the osTicket's root folder:
  - Replace first line for second line
    //define('CLIENTINC_DIR',INCLUDE_DIR.'client/');
    define('CLIENTINC_DIR','client/');
- Repeat the last step for the file login.php
- Edit the index.php (from osTicket) and comment (or delete) all the HTML code (no PHP) in order to see the template display correctly,
  then you just need to add this line before the footer in included: require(CLIENTINC_DIR.'main.inc.php');
- Now enter the new client folder and adjust the file config.php
- Go to your osTicket client interface and enjoy your new theme ;)

CAPTCHA CONFIGURATION

- Open config.php inside the client dir and enable captcha (set it to 1)
- Open ../open.php and paste the following code below the line: $inc='open.inc.php'; (line 19)

// CAPTCHA CONFIGURATION
include_once("client/config.php");
include_once(CTHEME_PATH."php-captcha.inc.php");
if (CTHEME_CAPTCHA && $_POST) {
  if (!PhpCaptcha::Validate($_POST['captcha_img'])) {
    $errors['ctcaptcha'] = $ctlang->dot('open_017');
    require(CLIENTINC_DIR.'header.inc.php');
    require(CLIENTINC_DIR.$inc);
    require(CLIENTINC_DIR.'footer.inc.php');
    exit;
  }
}

- Save it, and have fun ;)
- Additional PHP configutions might be needed to use this captcha, GD and TTF are at least required.
